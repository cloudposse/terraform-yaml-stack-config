      # NOTE: component types
      # Privileged components are those that require elevated (root-level) permissions to provision and access their remote state.
      # For example: `tfstate-backend`, `account`, `account-map`, `account-settings`, `iam-primary`.
      # Privileged components are usually provisioned during cold-start (when we don't have any IAM roles provisioned yet) by using an admin user credentials.
      # To access the remote state of privileged components, the caller needs to have permissions to access the backend and the remote state without assuming roles.
      # Regular components, on the other hand, don't require root-level permissions and are provisioned and their remote state is accessed by assuming IAM roles (or using profiles).
      # For example: `vpc`, `eks`, `rds`

      # NOTE: global `backend` config
      # The global `backend` config should be declared in a global YAML stack config file (e.g. `globals.yaml`)
      # where all stacks can import it and have access to it (note that the global `backend` config is organization-wide and will not change after cold-start).
      # The global `backend` config in the global config file should always have the `role_arn` or `profile` specified (added after the cold-start).

      # NOTE: components `backend` config
      # The `backend` portion for each individual component should be declared in a catalog file (e.g. `stacks/catalog/<component>.yaml`)
      # along with all the default values for a component.
      # The `privileged` attribute should always be declared in the `backend` portion for each individual component in the catalog.
      # Top-level stacks where a component is provisioned import the component's catalog (the default values and the component's backend config portion) and can override the default values.

      # NOTE: `cold-start`
      # During cold-start we don't have any IAM roles provisioned yet, so we use an admin user credentials to provision the privileged components.
      # The `privileged` attribute for the privileged components should be set to `true` in the components' catalog,
      # and the privileged components should be provisioned using an admin user credentials.

      # NOTE: after `cold-start`
      # After the privileged components (including the primary IAM roles) are provisioned, we update the global `backend` config in the global config file
      # to add the IAM role or profile to access the backend (after this, the global `backend` config should never change).
      # For some privileged components we can change the `privileged` attribute in the YAML config from `true` to `false`
      # to allow the regular components to access their remote state (e.g. we set the `privileged` attribute to `false` in the `account-map` component
      # since we use `account-map` in almost all regular components.
      # For each regular component, set the `privileged` attribute to `false` in the components'  portion of `backend` config (in `stacks/catalog/<component>.yaml`)

      # Advantages:
      # The global `backend` config is specified just once in the global config file, IAM role or profile is added to it after the cold start,
      # and after that the global `backend` config never changed.
      # We can make a component privileged or not any time by just updating its `privileged` attribute in the component's catalog file.
      # We can change a component's `backend` portion any time without touching/affection the backend configs of all other components (e.g. when we add a new
      # component, we don't touch the `globals.yaml` file at all, and we don't update the component's `role_arn` and `profile` settings).
